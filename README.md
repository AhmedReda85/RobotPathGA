```
## Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd path-planning
```
## Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```
Input the grid size, start point, goal point, and obstacle ratio.

## Usage

1. **Grid Size**: Set the size of the grid (e.g., 10 for a 10x10 grid).
2. **Start Position**: Enter the starting coordinates (x, y).
3. **Goal Position**: Enter the goal coordinates (x, y).
